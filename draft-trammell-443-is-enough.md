--- abstract

RFC 7605 provides guidance on the use of port numbers and the criteria
for new port assignments, including a test for whether a proposed service
is distinct from an existing service. RFC 7605 section 7.1 notes that
"an automated system that happens to use HTTP framing -- but is not
primarily accessed by a browser -- might be a new service." In practice,
this sentence has become the opening that applicants for new port
assignments reach for when their service is an HTTP-based API. This
document clarifies the application of the RFC 7605 section 7.1
distinctness test to HTTP-based services, in light of HTTP's evolution
since 2015 into a general-purpose application transport substrate, and
provides guidance to applicants and reviewers on when an HTTP-based
service qualifies for a new port assignment and when it does not.

# Notes
{:numbered="false"}

The following notes record the analysis behind this document and are
intended to guide drafting. They are not part of the final document.

## Context

RFC 7605 section 7.1 says an "automated system that happens to use HTTP
framing -- but is not primarily accessed by a browser -- might be a new
service." That sentence was written in 2015, when it was still reasonable
to treat HTTP as primarily a browser protocol with occasional non-browser
uses. It no longer reflects the landscape. HTTP/2 (RFC 7540, now RFC
9113) was explicitly designed as a general-purpose application transport
substrate -- multiplexed streams, binary framing, header compression --
with non-browser use as a first-class design goal. HTTP/3 (RFC 9114)
continues that trajectory over QUIC. The dominant application protocol
design pattern of the 2010s-2020s is: run your protocol over HTTP, use
TLS on port 443, differentiate by URL path and Content-Type. gRPC,
GraphQL, OpenAPI-described REST APIs, OCI registries, CalDAV, CardDAV --
all are HTTP profiles. The section 7.1 "might be a new service" sentence
was intended to leave room for this pattern where the wire-level protocol
is genuinely distinct; in practice it has become the opening every HTTP
API applicant reaches for.

## The Clarifying Test

The document needs to state clearly what "might be a new service" actually
requires. The relevant question is not "is this accessed by a browser?"
but "is the wire protocol distinct from HTTP?" A service is an HTTP
profile -- and does not qualify for a new port assignment -- if all of the
following hold:

- An unmodified HTTP client (operationalised: curl with appropriate
  headers) can issue requests and receive structurally valid responses.

- Service differentiation from other HTTP services is achieved via URL
  path structure, HTTP headers, Content-Type values, JSON schema, or
  authentication scheme -- all of which are application-layer conventions
  within HTTP, not wire-level distinctions.

- No transport-layer behaviour is required that falls outside standard
  HTTP semantics: the service does not require a UDP component, a
  non-HTTP framing layer, or an ALPN identifier distinct from h2, h2c,
  or http/1.1.

## The Escape Valves

The document should also define when an HTTP-based service does qualify.
Three cases:

1. The content encoding is genuinely opaque to a generic HTTP client -- a
   binary MIME type with a format no standard client library can parse
   without the application-specific codec. gRPC's application/grpc with
   protobuf is the canonical example; note that gRPC itself uses port 443
   with ALPN, not its own port.

2. The service has a substantial non-HTTP transport component on the same
   port (e.g., DTLS/UDP telemetry co-registered with the TCP API), where
   the combined service cannot be fully accessed by any unmodified HTTP
   client. The non-HTTP component must be implemented and specified, not
   merely claimed.

3. The service requires an ALPN identifier not already registered -- in
   which case the right registration is in the IANA TLS ALPN Protocol IDs
   registry (RFC 7301), not a new port.

## Alternative Mechanisms

For applicants whose service is an HTTP profile, the document should name
the better-suited mechanisms:

- ALPN registration (RFC 7301) for protocol-level differentiation under
  TLS.

- Well-Known URIs (RFC 8615) for service discovery.

- HTTP virtual hosting via Host header / TLS SNI for co-location of
  multiple services on the same port.

These mechanisms were designed specifically to support the ecosystem of
HTTP-based services without consuming the 16-bit port number space.

## Form and Venue

This should be a short Informational RFC (target 4-6 pages formatted),
submitted via the independent stream. It does not need working group
adoption to be useful -- it just needs to be stable and citable. An
Internet-Draft posted to the IETF datatracker achieves the "citable
stable document" goal even before publication, which is sufficient for
the port reviewer use case.

The framing should read as clarification of what RFC 7605 section 7.1
always meant, not as new policy. The unmodified-client test has always
been the rule; this document explains how to apply it to the
HTTP-as-substrate world that section 7.1 did not anticipate needing to
address explicitly.
